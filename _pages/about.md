My name is Victor Alejandro Ramirez Delgado, I am currently a 5th year Ph.D. student and Unidel Distinguished Fellow at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Delaware. I am also a visitng graduate student at the Mathematics and Computer Science Divison at Argone National Lab. I am originally from Caracas, Venezuela and moved to the United States in 2017 to pursue a career in astrophysics. My research interests encompass exoplanet detections, stellar astrophysics and time series analysis of astronomical data. In my free time I enjoy going for a swim, playing squash and playing soccer. Feel to reach out to me via email if you would like to learn more about my research.
