My name is Victor Alejandro Ramirez Delgado. I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student and Unidel Distinguished Fellow in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Delaware. I am also a **visiting** graduate student in the Mathematics and Computer Science **Division** at **Argonne** National Laboratory. My research interests include exoplanet detection, stellar astrophysics, and time-series analysis of astronomical data.

In my free time I enjoy swimming, playing squash, and playing soccer. **Feel free** to reach out by email if you would like to learn more about my research.
